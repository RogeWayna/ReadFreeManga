Comment from Mangahere
This Dragon Ball Super movie is a story that comes after the currently-airing anime. The story begins to reveal more about Frieza and the Saiyans, after a breather episode following the climax of the Tournament of Power, where the universe was at stake. We are to meet an especially powerful enemy, which is a story you surely will enjoy!

I have been carefully writing the movies from the year 2013 on. From Battle of Gods, Resurrection ‘F’ to the newest movie. I have also been drawing a lot of design illustrations and more.
I am as busy as always, but because I don’t have to serialize anything, I have room to think about the animation, which I previously didn’t upon touch at all [laugh]. So please wait for the movie in anticipation!

By the way, the TV anime is coming to an end for now, but Toyotaro’s popular manga series DB Super (five volumes have been released so far!) is to continue for a while. Please take a look at it, even though it is totally different from the TV anime and movies.
